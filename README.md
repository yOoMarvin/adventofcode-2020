# Advent of Code - 2020

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent Of Code 2020. All solutions are written in Javascript.

## Getting Started

All puzzles and detailed instructions can be found at [AdventOfCode.com](https://adventofcode.com). There you can log in and go from puzzle to puzzle in a gripping Christmas story!
For the more eager, there is even a worldwide leaderboard. On this output page you will find the complete input for the puzzles and the solutions.

To run the code, simply navigate to the respective folder with the commandline and leave the script with

`node puzzle-01.js`

(or any other program name). The respective output should appear on the console.
